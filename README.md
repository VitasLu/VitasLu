- 👋 Hi, I’m @VitasLu
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies, and immersing myself in different cultures through travel and cuisine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) algorithms to enhance communication and interaction between humans and machines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to NLP, ASR, or any interdisciplinary projects that involve both.
